    <h1> The Trade War with China </h1>
    <h5>
      For the past year, the world’s largest economic powerhouses, the US and China, have engaged in a trade war. After the Trump administration imposed $34 billion of tariffs (taxes on imports) on Chinese goods. The purpose of these tariffs are to punish Chinese businesses by driving American consumers to buy non-Chinese products due to the resulting increase in price. In response to the US’s tariffs, China imposed $34 billion of tariffs on American goods. Both country’s tariffs were designed to hit deep and the trade war has progressed. As more and more tariffs are imposed, consumers in both countries are forced to pay more for goods and the US and Chinese economies suffer.
