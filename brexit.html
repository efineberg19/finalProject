    <h1> Brexit </h1>

<h5>
Brexit, which is short for “Britain Exit” is the event of the UK leaving the European Union. On Thursday, June 23, 2016 an election was held and 51.9% of the voters voted that the UK should leave the European Union. The separation is planned to happen on October 31st, 2019. However, this isn’t a point of no return. The UK could cancel article 50 which would in return cancel Brexit. If they do decide go through with it, the UK will have to pay the EU about £50 billion. If a “no deal” Brexit happens, which means Britain doesn’t benefit from the separation, their tariffs will be reimposed, which can be as high as 74%. It will also make trade and travel much harder in Ireland.
