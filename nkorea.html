   <h1> North Korea </h1>
   <h6>
     North Korea was created along with South Korea at the end of World War II. Since 1948, North Korea has been ruled by three men from the same family who are viewed as gods by the people. Kim Il-sung, then Kim Jong-il, and now Kim Jong-il's son, Kim Jong-un.
     North Korea is home to more than 25 million people, who live under communist rule, which strictly controls all areas of life. Most North Koreans have little or no idea of world events, or foreign opinions of North Korea. Most North Koreans are extremely poor. However, North Koreans who demand more from their government, support change in leadership, or try to escape, are brutally punished and sometimes killed.
     North Korea is trying to make and frequently tests nuclear missiles which one day could have the range to target the US. In November 2017, North Korea claims to have successfully tested a new missile which could reach the whole of the US.
